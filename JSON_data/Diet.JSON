    "Bulking": {
        "description": "Bulking focuses on muscle gain through a calorie surplus and high protein intake. This phase involves consuming more calories than your body burns, which, combined with resistance training, leads to muscle growth. It's not just about eating more, but eating smartly to provide your body with the nutrients it needs to grow.",

    "Cutting": {
        "description": "Cutting aims at reducing body fat while maintaining muscle mass through a calorie deficit and balanced diet. This phase involves eating fewer calories than you burn, leading to fat loss. It's essential to maintain a high protein intake to preserve muscle mass while losing fat. Cutting should be done gradually to ensure that muscle loss is minimized.",
